#### Information about the European Accessibility Act (EAA)

A space for requirements and technical information.

Digital teams will be at different stages of analysis to identify accessibility gaps in their products and services.

For example:
* identify EAA gaps across existing products and services and upcoming developments
* understand how the development process currently ensures accessibility requirements
* define the requirements and tasks needed to upgrade products to meet the EAA directive
* prioritise the implementation of tasks
* identify knowledge and skill gaps and identify training
* identify common, reusable elements of software, tools, and processes across projects
* monitor accessibility status within products or projects, methods may include: audit, visualisation, automation

Teams will need to identify strategies to deliver products that meet EAA requirements. For example:
* technician-centric (e.g. ad hoc use of specialist skills)
* knowledge/process-centric (e.g. upskill and improve knowledge among teams to adjust to a collaborative mindset and approach where accessibility requirements and implementation are included by default as a component within a product development process)
* automation/tooling
